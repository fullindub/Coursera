<h1>Modes of transport</h1>

<h2 id="car">Car</h2>
<p>Travelling by car is very practical. For example you can travel wherever, whenever without having to rely on public transport. However the costs of petrol and insurance can be very high as well as most cars can only fit a maximum of 5 people.

<h2 id="train">Train</h2>
<p>Travelling by train is great if you dont have a car and are travelling with a lot of people. It is also good for a 1 time transport since its cheaper than buying a car. However overtime the cost of travel by train adds up. Moreover, it is very unlikely there will be a train station exactly where you're traveling.

<h2 id="taxi">Taxi</h2>
<p>Taxis are a very handy mode of transport when you are intoxicated. They take you exactly where you need to be and its as effective as driving your own car without actually having to drive. Cost wise however taxis are horrible. A short journey can cost a huge amount of money as well as the fact that 1 taxi cant hold a lot of people.
